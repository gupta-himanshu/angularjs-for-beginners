1. **AngularJS** is a structural framework for dynamic web applications. It lets you use
HTML as your template language and lets you extend HTML's syntax to express your
application components clearly and succinctly. Its data binding and dependency
injection eliminate much of the code you currently have to write. And it all happens
within the browser, making it an ideal partner with any server technology.
2. General Features of AngularJS are:
   * AngularJS is a efficient framework that can create Rich Internet Applications (RIA).
   * AngularJS provides developers an options to write client side applications 
using JavaScript in a clean Model View Controller (MVC) way.
   * Applications written in AngularJS are cross-browser compliant. AngularJS
automatically handles JavaScript code suitable for each browser.
   * AngularJS is open source, completely free, and used by thousands of
developers around the world. It is licensed under the Apache license version
2.0.
3. The most important core features of AngularJS are:
   * **Data-binding**: It is the automatic synchronization of data between model and
view components.
   * **Scope**: These are objects that refer to the model. They act as a glue between
controller and view.
   * **Controller**: These are JavaScript functions bound to a particular scope.
   * **Services**: AngularJS comes with several built-in services such as $http to
make a XMLHttpRequests. These are singleton objects which are instantiated
only once in app.
   * **Filters**: These select a subset of items from an array and returns a new array.
   * **Directives**: Directives are markers on DOM elements such as elements,
attributes, css, and more. These can be used to create custom HTML tags that
serve as new, custom widgets. AngularJS has built-in directives such as
ngBind, ngModel etc.
   * **Templates**:These are the rendered view with information from the controller
and model. These can be a single file (such as index.html) or multiple views
in one page using partials.
   * **Routing**: It is concept of switching views.
   * **Model View Whatever**: MVW is a design pattern for dividing an application
into different parts called Model, View, and Controller, each with distinct
responsibilities. AngularJS does not implement MVC in the traditional sense,
but rather something closer to MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel). The Angular
JS team refers it humorously as Model View Whatever.
   * **Deep Linking**: Deep linking allows you to encode the state of application in
the URL so that it can be bookmarked. The application can then be restored
from the URL to the same state.
   * **Dependency Injection**: AngularJS has a built-in dependency injection
subsystem that helps the developer to create,understand, and test the
applications easily.
